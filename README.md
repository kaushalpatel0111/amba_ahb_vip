# 🧪 AMBA AHB Verification IP (VIP)

This repository contains my **AMBA AHB Verification IP (VIP)** project, developed during my internship at **Scaledge Technology** (Feb 2025 – May 2025).  
The goal of this project is to build a reusable, modular, and protocol-compliant Verification IP for the **AMBA AHB bus protocol** based on the ARM Specification.
